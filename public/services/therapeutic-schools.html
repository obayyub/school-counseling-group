        <h4>THERAPEUTIC SCHOOLS</h4>
        <p>Therapeutic schools cater to students who are struggling with emotional and/or behavioral issues to the extent that they cannot safely or productively function in their home environment any longer. The focus is on helping and guiding the students holistically on therapeutic, academic and social levels.</p>

        <h4>The Initial Meeting</h4>
        <p>We ask that the parents and the child come to the initial meeting. At times of extreme crisis, we realize that this is not always possible, but it is our goal to gather as much information as possible in the initial meeting, and we do this best when we hear everyone's voice. There are two goals for the first meeting.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The first is assessment. We want to get a clear picture of what motivates a student and what is getting in the way of healthy functioning in the present. The counselor then spends some time alone with the student, followed by some time alone with the parents, in order to gather multiple perspectives in a short period of time.</p></li>
          <li><p>The second goal is to understand the goals of the family for this process. It is our job to assist you to find options that can best help you and your child. During of the initial meeting, the counselor will establish a plan of action based on solid assessment, shared mutual understanding and goals.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Continued Assesment</h4>
        <p>Please bring with you and/or send us written documents that will be useful in our assessment. This includes transcripts, psychological and/or educational assessments, reports and teacher comments. The counselor will review this information carefully, looking for corresponding patterns or, just as important, inconsistencies, strengths as well as deficits.</p>
        <p>The counselor will communicate with other professionals you designate to have insight into your child, including therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, coaches, or other family members.</p>
        <h4>The List of Options</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Once the counselor has a clear picture of the student and family as well as the goals for the process, the counselor formulates a list of options and a process for evaluating them. Our counselors have a vast knowledge of the programs around the country and use the assessment of your child to narrow the options to the best possible programs for your child and family. By the time you receive the list, the counselor has often spoken with an admissions representative of each school/program to determine if there is space available, the current status of the milieu, and the fit of your child to the program.</p></li>
          <li><p>You will use the list to do your own research of the programs. It is very important that you gather information for yourself, as ultimately you will be making the decision. The counselor will be there to support you and answer your questions. You will be responsible for calling the admissions professionals as directed and, when appropriate, scheduling tours of the programs. Tours are not necessary for a placement in Wilderness Therapy Programs, but are highly recommended for all other placements.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Placement</h4>
        <p>Once you have selected the most appropriate program for your child, you will begin working closely with the program's admissions director of the program. Your counselor will also be working closely with this person to assure that they have all of the information they need and to support smooth placement. The counselor will help you make decisions about the best way to transport your child to the program and how best to communicate and to support the process.</p>
        <h4>Continued Participation with the Process</h4>
        <p>After your child begins the new program, your counselor will stay in regular communication with that program to stay on top of the student's progress. Our continued involvement allows for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>We can help you and your family if you are struggling with the process or have concerns about the program</p></li>
          <li><p>We remain aware of how your child is doing so that we can help you prepare for the transition home or to find aftercare placement options</p></li>
          <li><p>We help "translate" and support treatment objectives, the goals of which are to strengthen the child as well as the family system</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Transition</h4>
        <p>As your child moves towards completing the program, your counselor will work closely with the program therapist and with you to help determine the best options for transition. Transition services may or may not be covered in the initial cost, which will be addressed during the initial consultation, and again before the transition process begins. We can also provide recommendations for local professionals when appropriate.</p>
