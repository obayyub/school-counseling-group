        <h4>WHAT IS OUR PROCESS?</h4>
        <p>The first step is to call (202-333-3530). If you are seeking college counseling, you will be invited to call our College Counselor directly. If you are seeking placement in a day school, boarding school, or therapeutic school, you will speak with our Client Coordinator, who will gather preliminary information and help direct you to the best counselor for your child and your family.</p>
        <p>Our clients are unique and special people, and we are privileged to work with families whose priorities we share. Some of our clients require a more specialized intervention, clinical approach or understanding, such as a student with a learning issue, an emotional issue, a developmental disability, a pervasive behavioral issue or some combination thereof which does not lend itself easily to a typical school setting. Within each service area (e.g. day school, boarding school, college, gap year), and not just within specialized therapeutic schools and programs, there are possibilities which may best address a given special need at a particular developmental juncture. To determine the best match requires great skill and experience and is one of our firm's specialties.</p>
        <p>The placement process varies slightly with each client, depending on the current situation as well as the type of school placement required.</p>

        <h4>Materials Needed:</h4>
        <p>Regardless of which service you select, we ask families to provide before, during and/or after following the initial meeting as much relevant written data as possible for our review; such as: grade/transcripts, report cards with teacher comments, IEP's, standardized, educational and/or psychological testing and any other materials families may consider relevant or useful (writing samples, art work, letters of recommendation, etc.)</p>

        <h4>What should parents expect?</h4>
        <p>Parents should expect solid preliminary assessment, accurate useful guidance about school options, and honest reflection and feedback on each child; as well as parental understanding and involvement. We are partners with you in the process; we will be respectful, honest, and validating. We look forward to entering into a partnership with you and your child.</p>
