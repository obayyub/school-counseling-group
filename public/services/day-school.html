        <h4>DAY SCHOOL</h4>
        <p>Whether you are new to the Greater Washington area or contemplating a local change of schools, a consultation with an experienced and knowledgeable counselor could save you both time and wasted energy by focusing your search upon the right schools for the right reasons. Having placed hundreds of students in local day schools for decades, we have developed not only an understanding of school programs and the kinds of students they can support best, but also an understanding of important distinctions when comparing school cultures, styles and philosophies. Our role is to assist parents in assessing, planning and applying - to help make sense of numerous choices in an efficient manner guided by common sense, experience and the relational understanding we cultivate through our work.</p>
        <h4>DAY SCHOOL PROCESS</h4>
        <p>The first step is to call us and make an initial inquiry. Once in contact with an SCG representative, you will be asked a number of questions to help us quickly gain an essential overview and perspective. This information then allows us to direct you to the best consultant and recommend the right service level for you and your child. Often, families will be invited to speak with a consultant separately as a way to begin the process of establishing a personal consulting relationship. We would like to clarify needs and expectations as much as possible before formalizing a professional relationship. A comfortable working relationship built on integrity and mutual respect supports the best outcomes possible.</p>
        <h4>SCG Offers Three Levels of Day School Services</h4>
        <p>An initial hourly meeting may be a good way to start - or it may provide enough perspective and guidance to assure you that you are prepared to manage this process on your own. The advisory enables you to compile a list of schools specifically targeted to your child. The comprehensive service offers a list of schools and on-going professional guidance, as well as the support and collaboration of our whole group, until the placement at a new school is finalized. Hourly or advisory service is valuable as a standalone, or applicable to a more comprehensive level of service and support, outlined as follows:</p>

                Includes the initial meeting, plus any additional service necessary to generate an appropriate list of recommended schools. The counselor meets with the family, reviews all relevant materials (provided by the client before or shortly after the initial meeting), and makes follow-up phone calls with key professionals knowledgeable about your child. The counselor then provides recommendations of schools that are most appropriate and explains the differences among them. After the list is provided and explained, it becomes the client's responsibility to move forward with the admissions process. Additional support may be available on an hourly basis.

                Includes the advisory services plus additional or on-going calls with professionals, refined school recommendations, management/dissemination of admissions materials to prospective schools (deciding what and when to send), as well as advocacy on behalf of your child/family. We serve as a central clearinghouse for all admissions documents (transcripts, recommendations, testing, etc.) and will send all materials to the schools according to application deadlines and troubleshoot concerns that may arise during the admissions cycle. As a standard, the counselor will speak with prospective schools to address any questions or concerns they may have about an applicant, to gather useful feedback on the visit/interview, as well as to ensure that each school has a completed application file. Throughout the application process, parents will seek the counselor's advice regarding interview preparation, testing and test preparation, essay/application review, learning differences, and school fit.
