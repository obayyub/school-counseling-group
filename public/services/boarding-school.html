        <h3>BOARDING SCHOOL</h3>
        <p>There are nearly 300 boarding schools in the US and abroad offering a surprisingly varied menu of academic, social and extra-curricular options. As a community of students and teachers living, learning and recreating together, boarding schools provide a unique sense of community and high levels of bonding and interaction rarely experienced in day programs, public or private. As a consequence of caring for the whole individual and meeting the varied needs of a diverse student body, a boarding school builds natural structure into the day and week which, in turn, promotes personal growth, involvement in new experiences and unique opportunities for leadership and responsibility. The sense of community and its ordered rhythms innately support and encourage each student's personal development in academics, the arts, athletics and social development. There are traditional college preparatory boarding schools built on the English public school model, those schools which work exclusively with the younger student, those schools which primarily support students with learning differences, or those schools organized around a particular ethos or theme (e.g. military, single-sex, experiential, Quaker, international or post-graduate).</p>

        <h4>Boarding School Process</h4>
        <p>The first step is to speak with our Client Relations Coordinator, who will gather background information about your child in order to decide which counselor is best suited to meet your needs. During this call, we will clarify how our services work, discuss fees, and answer any other questions you may have. Once our services are explained, you may opt to set up an initial courtesy call with the appropriate counselor.</p>
        <p>Our counselors are as eager to learn about you as you may be about us; a good working relationship begins by establishing clear, mutually satisfying expectations at the outset of the partnership. We believe that the relationship between you and your counselor is the single-most important ingredient to a satisfying result.</p>

        <h4>Consultation</h4>
        <p>The initial appointment, called a consultation, generally lasts from 1.5 to 2 hours and is roughly divided into three sections: a meeting with the whole family, a separate meeting with the student, and a final meeting with parents/guardian. The consultation sets the boundaries for, and establishes the direction of, our work. In some cases, the notion of boarding school is one which the client has introduced to the initial discussion. In others, the initial discussions themselves may offer boarding schools as a newly considered option.</p>
        <p>Please provide us with transcripts, any recent testing (standardized, educational, neuropsychological) and be prepared to share the names of relevant professionals whom you think would provide us with meaningful insights. During the meeting you will be provided a disclosure statement granting us permission to speak confidentially with teachers, counselors or others you feel would be helpful to our understanding. Our goal is to determine the best "match." The more accurate and comprehensive a picture we have of your child, the better able we will be to find the best setting.</p>

        <h4>Comprehensive</h4>
        <p>Having met with the student and family, spoken with relevant professionals and reviewed records and testing, your counselor will create a working list of schools aligned with the established criteria. As your advocate in this process, we will share an overview with potential schools providing a summation of the student's interests, abilities and any special concerns, academic or otherwise. We engage in frank, clarifying conversations with admissions officers or other school officials to establish that a possible "match" is in order. At this point, the school will be instructed to send out their materials to you for your review. Once the canvassing period has taken place, families will be given a refined list of target schools for further consideration, and parents at this point are invited to make personal contact with admissions offices to learn more about the institution and each other, to share impressions and, if so desired, to explore possibilities for visits and interviews.</p>
        <p>The role of the SCG counselor varies according to each family's needs, comfort and desires. As a standard, the counselor will speak with prospective schools to address any questions or concerns they may have about an applicant, gather useful feedback on the visit/interview, and ensure that each school has a completed application file. Throughout the application process, parents will seek the counselor's advice regarding interview preparation, testing and test preparation, essay/application review, learning differences, and school fit.</p>
        <p>The comprehensive service offers a well-vetted list of schools and on-going professional guidance, as well as the support and collaboration of our whole group, until the placement at a new school is finalized.</p>
