        <h4>THERAPEUTIC SCHOOLS</h4>
        <p>Therapeutic schools cater to students who are struggling with emotional and/or behavioral issues to the extent that they cannot safely or productively function in their home environment any longer. The focus is on helping and guiding the whole person, serving the students on therapeutic levels, academic and social levels.</p>

        <h4>The Initial Meeting</h4>
        <p>We generally ask that all parents and the child come to the initial meeting. At times of extreme crisis, we realize that this will not always be possible, but it is our goal to gather as much information as possible in the initial meeting, and we do this best when we hear everyone's voice. There are two goals for the first meeting.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The first is assessment. We want to get a clear picture of what motivates the students and what is getting in their way of being successful right now. The counselor then spends some time alone with the student, followed by some time alone with the parents, in order to gather multiple perspectives in a short period of time.</p></li>
          <li><p>The second goal is to understand the goals of the family for this process. It is our job to help you find the options that can help you and your child. You inform this process by helping us to understand what you hope can be different. By the end of the initial meeting, the counselor sets forth a plan with the family about the next steps and the direction we will be going.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Continued Assesment</h4>
        <p>You will bring with you and/or send us other separately written documents that will be useful in our assessment. This includes transcripts, psychological and/or educational assessments, reports and teacher comments. The counselor reviews this information carefully, looking for corresponding patterns or, just as important, inconsistencies, strengths as well as deficits.</p>
        <p>The counselor will also communicate with other professionals you indicate to have insight into your child, such as therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, coaches, or other family members.</p>
        <h4>The List of Options</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Once the counselor has a clear picture of the student and family as well as the goals for the process, the counselor formulates a list of options and a process for evaluating them. Our counselors have a vast knowledge of the programs around the country and use the assessment of your child to narrow the options to the best possible programs for your child and family. By the time you receive the list, the counselor has often spoken with an admissions representative of each school/program to determine if there is space available, the current status of the milieu, and the fit of your child to the program.</p></li>
          <li><p>You will use the list to do your own research of the programs. It is very important that you gather information for yourself, as ultimately you will be making the decision. The counselor will be there to support you and answer your questions. You will be responsible for calling the admissions professionals as directed and, when appropriate, scheduling tours of the programs. Tours are not necessary for a placement in Wilderness Therapy Programs, but are highly recommended for all other placements.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Placement</h4>
        <p>Once you have selected the program for your child, you will begin working closely with the Admissions Director of the program. The counselor will also be working closely with this person to assure that they have all of the information they need and can help you to plan a smooth placement. We (and your selected program) will help you to make decisions about the best way to transport your child to the program and the logistics of making it happen.</p>
        <h4>Continued Participation with the Process</h4>
        <p>After your child begins at the new program, your counselor will stay in regular communication with that program to remain aware of the progress and work that is being done. Our continued involvement allows for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>We can help you and your family if you are struggling with the process or have concerns about the program</p></li>
          <li><p>We remain aware of how your child is doing so that we can help you prepare for the transition home or to find aftercare placement options</p></li>
          <li><p>We help "translate" and support treatment objectives, the goals of which are to strengthen the child as well as the family system</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Transition</h4>
        <p>As your child gets closer to completing the program, the counselor works closely with the program therapist and with you to help determine the best options for transition. When appropriate, we provide additional lists of aftercare programs. We can also provide recommendations for local professionals when appropriate. Transition services may or may not be covered in the initial cost, which will be addressed during the initial consultation, and again before the transition process begins.</p>
