        <h4>WHY HIRE A CONSULTANT?</h4>
        <br />
        <h4>You have a lot at stake</h4>
        <p>Your financial and emotional investment is enormous. You want to make the best possible decision for your child's emotional health and academic future. Our expertise and objectivity allows us to help you make the best use of your resources. We spend thousands of hours visiting and thoroughly investigating colleges, schools, and specialized programs and building a database of information about them.</p>

        <h4>The information available is vast and confusing</h4>
        <p>As you begin to search for the right option for your child, you discover a wealth of information. Exploring further, you become overwhelmed. Websites are filled with pictures and statements that all begin to blend. You wonder if some of this information may be inaccurate or out of date. Our goal is to provide you with clear and accurate information and to clarify differences amongst the available options that may be difficult to discern. We help you to understand the various languages that are used to describe a diversity of schools and programs.</p>

        <h4>You want your child to be safe and well cared for</h4>
        <p>We only refer to schools and programs whose priority is to keep their students safe, physically and emotionally. We refer to schools and programs that our team has personally visited. We have met and maintain relationships with the people who operate them. Often, we have experience with other clients who have attended a particular school and have spoken with other students at the program. We only refer to schools and programs that make it a priority to keep their students safe and cared for.</p>

        <h4>It can be difficult to know exactly what your child needs</h4>
        <p>Our experience and professional objectivity allows us to assess your child and family and understand what level and type of support and structure will be most helpful. You have received some recommendations from other professionals, but there are nuances to and coded language within these recommendations that we are able to interpret and understand after many years of experience. Our assessment is perhaps the most important aspect of our work with you. It is a priority for us to meet with your child as well as with you. We also make it a priority, with your permission, to speak with others who can shed particular light on the student's needs</p>

        <h4>You need an advocate in this process</h4>
        <p>We are not affiliated with any specific schools or programs. We do not receive compensation for referrals. Our role as a consultant is to help you to understand your options and find what you are looking for. During the process, we can provide you with helpful questions to ask and will communicate with schools and programs on your behalf to begin the process of admission. Once you have made a decision, it is customary to stay in contact with the school to follow your child's progress and to help you work together with the school when there are challenges.</p>
