        <h4>WHY HIRE A CONSULTANT?</h4>
        <br />
        <h4>You have a lot at stake</h4>
        <p>Your financial and emotional investment is enormous. You want to make the best possible decision for your child's emotional health and academic future. Our expertise and objectivity allows us to help you make the best use of your resources. We have amassed thousands of hours spent visiting and investigating colleges, schools, and specialized programs in order to build a comprehensive database of information.</p>

        <h4>The information available is vast and confusing</h4>
        <p>As you begin to search for the right option for your child, you discover a wealth of information. Exploring further, you become overwhelmed. Websites are filled with pictures and statements that all begin to blend. You wonder if some of this information may be inaccurate or out of date. Our goal is to provide you with clear and accurate information and to clarify differences amongst the available options that may be difficult to discern. We help you to understand the various languages that are used to describe a diversity of schools and programs.</p>

        <h4>You want your child to be safe and well cared for</h4>
        <p>We only refer to schools and programs whose priority is to keep their students safe, physically and emotionally. We refer to schools and programs that our team has personally visited and maintain relationships with the staff who operate them. Often, we have placed other clients at a particular school and have spoken with other students at the program.</p>

        <h4>It can be difficult to know exactly what your child needs</h4>
        <p>Our experience and professional objectivity allows us to assess your child and family to understand what level and type of support and structure will be most helpful. Perhaps you have received recommendations from other professionals, but there are nuances and coded language within these recommendations that we are able to interpret for you. Our assessment is perhaps the most important aspect of our work with you. It is a priority for us to meet with your child as well as with you. We also make it a priority, with your permission, to speak with others who can shed particular light on your child's needs.</p>

        <h4>You need an advocate in this process</h4>
        <p>We are not affiliated with any specific schools or programs. We do not receive compensation for referrals. Our role as a consultant is to help you to understand your options and find what you are looking for. During the process, we can provide you with helpful questions to ask and will communicate with schools and programs on your behalf to begin the process of admission. Once you have made a decision, it is customary to stay in contact with the school to follow your child's progress and to help you work together with the school when there are challenges.</p>
