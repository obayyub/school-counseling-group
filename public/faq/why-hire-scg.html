        <h4>WHY HIRE US?</h4>
        <p>The Founder of SCG, Ethna Hopper, is lauded as a visionary educational counselor, having guided thousands of families with her rare combination of compassion, creativity, integrity and practiced good judgment. This balanced approach still informs the quality and spirit of the work carried on since 2001 under the direction of Peter Sturtevant, a former head of school and career educator.</p>

        <h4>Client-centered Focus</h4>
        <p>Our role is to understand, not to judge. A unique, professional relationship begins with a complete and thoughtful analysis of needs and shared objectives. We search the deeper meanings beneath success or failure as possible clues to personal growth and self-fulfillment, and we undertake this journey in a spirit of partnership and discovery. There is no such thing as "one size fits all" when it comes to placing a child or young adult. That's why accurate assessment is so essential to the process. We will not rush this process or make specific recommendations until we truly understand your child and your family. That is why it is such a priority for us to meet the student as well as the parents. Even in difficult situations when a student is resistant or disengaged, we are skilled at gathering key information to make an appropriate placement. In rare situations where it is impossible for us to meet the child, we will gather as much information as possible from you and other sources before we make recommendations.</p>

        <h4>Ongoing School Visits</h4>
        <p>We make it a priority to visit and revisit all of the schools and programs to which we refer. It is essential that we have the most recent and accurate information about schools and programs in order to find the best fit for your child. Our college counselors make ongoing tours of colleges and universities an annual priority. Our day and boarding school counselors visit campuses multiple times and continue to return periodically to clarify each school's student population and to understand faculty changes that may influence the fit. Our therapeutic boarding consultant spends as much as one week per month on average touring programs throughout the country, fostering ongoing relationships with specific therapists and admissions directors in order to best understand the environment to which we refer.</p>

        <h4>Team Approach</h4>
        <p>Educational counseling is an individual endeavor. However, we take pride in our ability to utilize our collective expertise in a variety of areas to best serve our clients. You will work under the leadership of one primary consultant, but each professional relies on the experiences and proficiency of the team as we conceptualize a case and seek the best possible outcomes.</p>

        <h4>Flexibility</h4>
        <p>Because we work together as a group, you can generally schedule an appointment with one of our counselors within a week (or more quickly if warranted) of the time of your call. We are sensitive to time issues and can work very quickly when needed. We will not shortchange the assessment process in the interest of time, but we can work quickly, perhaps because you are looking at a new school right before the semester begins or due to an emotional or behavioral crisis requiring immediate intervention.</p>

        <h4>Community and Professional Relationships</h4>
        <p>We have spent decades establishing and nurturing educational and therapeutic relationships in the Greater Washington area, as well as nationally and, in some cases, internationally. We maintain relationships with admissions and other key professionals in the organizations with which we work. Though we never guarantee admission because of our relationships, and we never receive any compensation for admissions, our relationships allow us to have productive conversations with each school. Admissions professionals know us and trust that we believe in matching the right student with the right school, and that we are mission, not profit, driven.</p>

        <h4>Experience and Professionalism</h4>
        <p>Collectively, our counselors have logged decades in a variety of settings as teachers, administrators, counselors and coaches. After 35 years in operation, we have helped thousands of families find the right placements or solutions for their children. Our counselors have earned at least one advanced degree a degree in fields related to education or counseling. We belong to professional associations and maintain a strong presence in the field of educational consulting. We believe in the work we do and stand by our reputation.</p>

        <h4>Compassion</h4>
        <p>Perhaps the most important distinguishing factor of SCG is the people you'll encounter here. We realize that these are very important and stressful decisions and we are committed to helping you through this process with kindness, integrity, and thoughtfulness. We are honest in our assessments and honor all information with utmost care and discretion. We respect each individual we encounter and we believe that each person has an essential voice in the process of change.</p>
